# Apito Engine

Open-source, API-first infrastructure to model data, manage content, enforce access rules, and run at scale. This repository contains the Apito Console (Open Core) â€” a modern, web-based admin UI for managing your Apito projects.

Reference: the overall project vision and tone follow the Apito Engine README. See the engine repository for core concepts and ecosystem context: [apito-io/engine README](https://github.com/apito-io/engine/blob/main/README.md).

## Features

- Schema modeling UI with drag-and-drop
- Content management with relations and rich text
- Roles, permissions, and logic settings
- API reference and GraphiQL explorer
- Plugin system and plugin settings UI
- Media manager integration
- Project, environment, and team settings

## Tech Stack

- React 19, TypeScript 5, Vite 7
- Ant Design 5
- GraphQL 16, Apollo Client 3
- pnpm 9 (via Corepack)

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (recommended via Corepack)

## Getting Started

1) Install dependencies

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.15.4 --activate
pnpm install
```

2) Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

3) Build and preview

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

4) (Optional) Generate GraphQL types/hooks

```bash
pnpm codegen
```

## Configuration

At runtime, the console reads environment variables that are injected into the built assets. When running via Docker (see below), these are written to `env.js` on container start:

- `VITE_REST_API` (default: `https://api.apito.io`)
- `VITE_GRAPH_API` (default: `https://api.apito.io/secured/graphql`)
- `VITE_GRAPH_SUBS_API` (default: `wss://api.apito.io/secured/graphql`)
- `VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER` (default: `apito`)
- `VITE_PUBLIC_GRAPH_API` (default: `https://api.apito.io/secured/graphql`)
- `VITE_COOKIE_DOMAIN` (example: `.udbhabon.com`)

You can set these as needed in your deployment environment.

## Docker

Build a production image and run it:

```bash
# Build
docker build -t apito-console:latest .

# Run (override ports and env vars as needed)
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e VITE_REST_API="https://api.apito.io" \
  -e VITE_GRAPH_API="https://api.apito.io/secured/graphql" \
  -e VITE_GRAPH_SUBS_API="wss://api.apito.io/secured/graphql" \
  -e VITE_AUTH_PROVIDER="apito" \
  -e VITE_PUBLIC_GRAPH_API="https://api.apito.io/secured/graphql" \
  -e VITE_COOKIE_DOMAIN=".example.com" \
  apito-console:latest
```

## CI/CD

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Installs dependencies with pnpm using the lockfile
- Builds static assets and uploads a release artifact on tag pushes (`v*.*.*`)
- Builds and pushes a multi-arch Docker image to GHCR

To create a release, tag the commit and push:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
